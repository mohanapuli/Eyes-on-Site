Eyes On Site:
Overview
The PPE Detection System aims to enhance worker safety on construction sites by using advanced machine learning algorithms for real-time, accurate detection of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as helmets, safety vests, gloves, and goggles. The system integrates with live video feeds and uses face recognition technology to identify individuals not wearing the required PPE, allowing for personalized alerts and detailed reporting.

Features
1)Real-Time PPE Detection: Utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for fast and accurate detection of PPE items.
2)Face Recognition: Identifies individuals and checks for PPE compliance.
3)Alert System: Issues immediate alerts and notifications to supervisors when non-compliance is detected.
4)Data Collection & Reporting: Collects data on PPE compliance, providing detailed reports and analytics.
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the chosen framework for YOLO)
OpenCV
Dlib
Face_recognition library
